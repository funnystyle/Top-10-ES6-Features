## 1. Default Parameters in ES6

## 1. 기본 매개변수

Remember we had to do these statements to define default parameters:

기본 매개변수를 정의할 때 아래와 같은 방법을 써야만 했던 것을 떠올려보자.
  
```javascript
var link = function (height, color, url) {
    var height = height || 50
    var color = color || 'red'
    var url = url || 'http://azat.co'
    ...
}
```
They were okay until the value was 0 and because 0 is falsy in JavaScript it would default to the hard-coded value instead of becoming the value itself. Of course, who needs 0 as a value (#sarcasmfont), so we just ignored this flaw and used the logic OR anyway… No more! In ES6, we can put the default values right in the signature of the functions:

이 방법은 값이 0만 아니면 괜찮은 방법이다. 왜냐하면 javascript 에서 0은 false를 의미하기 때문에 값이 0이 들어오면 0이 아니라 하드코딩한 값(오른쪽 값)이 default가 된다. ...(중략)... ES6에서는 함수를 정의할 때 변수 오른쪽에 default value 를 놓을 수 있다.

```javascript
var link = function(height = 50, color = 'red', url = 'http://azat.co') {
  ...
}
```
By the way, this syntax is similar to Ruby!

그런데, 이 문법은 루비랑 비슷하다!

## 2. Template Literals in ES6

Template literals or interpolation in other languages is a way to output variables in the string. So in ES5 we had to break the string like this:


```javascript
var name = 'Your name is ' + first + ' ' + last + '.'
var url = 'http://localhost:3000/api/messages/' + id
```

Luckily, in ES6 we can use a new syntax `${NAME}` inside of the back-ticked string:

```javascript
var name = `Your name is ${first} ${last}.`
var url = `http://localhost:3000/api/messages/${id}`
```

## 3. Multi-line Strings in ES6

Another yummy syntactic sugar is multi-line string. In ES5, we had to use one of these approaches:

```javascript
var roadPoem = 'Then took the other, as just as fair,\n\t'
    + 'And having perhaps the better claim\n\t'
    + 'Because it was grassy and wanted wear,\n\t'
    + 'Though as for that the passing there\n\t'
    + 'Had worn them really about the same,\n\t'

var fourAgreements = 'You have the right to be you.\n\
    You can only be you when you do your best.'
```

While in ES6, simply utilize the backticks:

```javascript
var roadPoem = `Then took the other, as just as fair,
    And having perhaps the better claim
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
    Though as for that the passing there
    Had worn them really about the same,`

var fourAgreements = `You have the right to be you.
    You can only be you when you do your best.`
```

## 4. Destructuring Assignment in ES6

Destructuring can be a harder concept to grasp, because there’s some magic going on… let’s say you have simple assignments where keys `house` and `mouse` are variables `house` and `mouse`:

```javascript
var data = $('body').data(), // data has properties house and mouse
  house = data.house,
  mouse = data.mouse
```

Other examples of destructuring assignments (from Node.js):

```javascript
var jsonMiddleware = require('body-parser').json

var body = req.body, // body has username and password
  username = body.username,
  password = body.password  
```

In ES6, we can replace the ES5 code above with these statements:

```javascript
var { house, mouse} = $('body').data() // we'll get house and mouse variables

var {jsonMiddleware} = require('body-parser')

var {username, password} = req.body
```

This also works with arrays. Crazy!

```javascript
var [col1, col2]  = $('.column'),
  [line1, line2, line3, , line5] = file.split('\n')
```

It might take some time to get use to the destructuring assignment syntax, but it’s a sweet sugarcoating.

## 5. Enhanced Object Literals in ES6

What you can do with object literals now is mind blowing! We went from a glorified version of JSON in ES5 to something closely resembling classes in ES6.

Here’s a typical ES5 object literal with some methods and attributes/properties:

```javascript
var serviceBase = {port: 3000, url: 'azat.co'},
    getAccounts = function(){return [1,2,3]}

var accountServiceES5 = {
  port: serviceBase.port,
  url: serviceBase.url,
  getAccounts: getAccounts,
  toString: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(this.valueOf())
  },
  getUrl: function() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
  valueOf_1_2_3: getAccounts()
}
```

If we want to be fancy, we can inherit from `serviceBase` by making it the prototype with the `Object.create` method:

```javascript
var accountServiceES5ObjectCreate = Object.create(serviceBase)
var accountServiceES5ObjectCreate = {
  getAccounts: getAccounts,
  toString: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(this.valueOf())
  },
  getUrl: function() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
  valueOf_1_2_3: getAccounts()
}
```

I know, `accountServiceES5ObjectCreate` and `accountServiceES5` are NOT totally identical, because one object (`accountServiceES5`) will have the properties in the `__proto__` object as shown below:

![Enhanced Object Literals in ES6](http://m03s6dh33i0jtc3uzfml36au-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/s-pYuaRxwA0HKoW-BmPPBmWARd9qzHY-dqIRyWg1mhU.png "Enhanced Object Literals in ES6")

But for the sake of the example, we’ll consider them similar. So in ES6 object literal, there are shorthands for assignment getAccounts: getAccounts, becomes just getAccounts,. Also, we set the prototype right there in the `__proto__` property which makes sense (not ‘proto’ though:

```javascript
var serviceBase = {port: 3000, url: 'azat.co'},
    getAccounts = function(){return [1,2,3]}
var accountService = {
    __proto__: serviceBase,
    getAccounts,
```

Also, we can invoke `super` and have dynamic keys (`valueOf_1_2_3`):

```javascript
    toString() {
     return JSON.stringify((super.valueOf()))
    },
    getUrl() {return "http://" + this.url + ':' + this.port},
    [ 'valueOf_' + getAccounts().join('_') ]: getAccounts()
};
console.log(accountService)
```

## 6. Arrow Functions in ES6

This is probably one feature I waited the most. I love CoffeeScript for its fat arrows. Now we have them in ES6. The fat arrows are amazing because they would make your `this` behave properly, i.e., `this` will have the same value as in the context of the function—it won’t mutate. The mutation typically happens each time you create a closure.

Using arrows functions in ES6 allows us to stop using `that = this` or `self = this` or `_this = this` or `.bind(this)`. For example, this code in ES5 is ugly:

```javascript
var _this = this
$('.btn').click(function(event){
  _this.sendData()
})
```

This is the ES6 code without `_this = this`:

```javascript
$('.btn').click((event) =>{
  this.sendData()
})
```

Sadly, the ES6 committee decided that having skinny arrows is too much of a good thing for us and they left us with a verbose old `function` instead. (Skinny arrow in CoffeeScript works like regular `function` in ES5 and ES6).

Here’s another example in which we use `call` to pass the context to the `logUpperCase()` function in ES5:

```javascript
var logUpperCase = function() {
  var _this = this

  this.string = this.string.toUpperCase()
  return function () {
    return console.log(_this.string)
  }
}

logUpperCase.call({ string: 'es6 rocks' })()
```

While in ES6, we don’t need to mess around with `_this`:

```javascript
var logUpperCase = function() {
  this.string = this.string.toUpperCase()
  return () => console.log(this.string)
}

logUpperCase.call({ string: 'es6 rocks' })()
```

Note that you can mix and match old `function` with `=>` in ES6 as you see fit. And when an arrow function is used with one line statement, it becomes an expression, i.e,. it will implicitly return the result of that single statement. If you have more than one line, then you’ll need to use `return` explicitly.

This ES5 code is creating an array from the `messages` array:

```javascript
var ids = ['5632953c4e345e145fdf2df8','563295464e345e145fdf2df9']
var messages = ids.map(function (value) {
  return "ID is " + value // explicit return
});
```

Will become this in ES6:

```javascript
var ids = ['5632953c4e345e145fdf2df8','563295464e345e145fdf2df9']
var messages = ids.map(value => `ID is ${value}`) // implicit return
```

Notice that I used the string templates? Another feature from CoffeeScript… I love them!

The parenthesis () are optional for single params in an arrow function signature. You need them when you use more than one param.

In ES5 the code has `function` with explicit return:

```javascript
var ids = ['5632953c4e345e145fdf2df8', '563295464e345e145fdf2df9'];
var messages = ids.map(function (value, index, list) {
  return 'ID of ' + index + ' element is ' + value + ' ' // explicit return
});
```

And more eloquent version of the code in ES6 with parenthesis around params and implicit return:

```javascript
var ids = ['5632953c4e345e145fdf2df8','563295464e345e145fdf2df9']
var messages = ids.map((value, index, list) => `ID of ${index} element is ${value} `) // implicit return
```

## 7. Promises in ES6

Promises have been a controversial topic. There were a lot of promise implementations with slightly different syntax. q, bluebird, deferred.js, vow, avow, jquery deferred to name just a few. Others said we don’t need promises and can just use async, generators, callbacks, etc. Gladly, there’s a standard `Promise` implementation in ES6 now!

Let’s consider a rather trivial example of a delayed asynchronous execution with `setTimeout()`:

```javascript
setTimeout(function(){
  console.log('Yay!')
}, 1000)
```

We can re-write the code in ES6 with Promise:

```javascript
var wait1000 =  new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 1000)
}).then(function() {
  console.log('Yay!')
})
```

Or with ES6 arrow functions:

```javascript
var wait1000 =  new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {
  setTimeout(resolve, 1000)
}).then(()=> {
  console.log('Yay!')
})
```

So far, we’ve increased the number of lines of code from three to five without any obvious benefit. That’s right. The benefit will come if we have more nested logic inside of the `setTimeout()` callback:

```javascript
setTimeout(function(){
  console.log('Yay!')
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('Wheeyee!')
  }, 1000)
}, 1000)
```

Can be re-written with ES6 promises:

```javascript
var wait1000 =  ()=> new Promise((resolve, reject)=> {setTimeout(resolve, 1000)})

wait1000()
    .then(function() {
        console.log('Yay!')
        return wait1000()
    })
    .then(function() {
        console.log('Wheeyee!')
    });
```

Still not convinced that Promises are better than regular callbacks? Me neither. I think once you got the idea of callbacks and wrap your head around them, then there’s no need for additional complexity of promises.

Nevertheless, ES6 has Promises for those of you who adore them. Promises have a fail-and-catch-all callback as well which is a nice feature. Take a look at this post for more info on promises: Introduction to ES6 Promises.

## 8. Block-Scoped Constructs Let and Const

You might have already seen the weird sounding let in ES6 code. I remember the first time I was in London, I was confused by all those TO LET signs. The ES6 let has nothing to do with renting. This is not a sugarcoating feature. It’s more intricate. `let` is a new `var` which allows to scope the variable to the blocks. We define blocks by the curly braces. In ES5, the blocks did NOTHING to the vars:

```javascript
function calculateTotalAmount (vip) {
  var amount = 0
  if (vip) {
    var amount = 1
  }
  { // more crazy blocks!
    var amount = 100
    {
      var amount = 1000
      }
  }  
  return amount
}

console.log(calculateTotalAmount(true))
```

The result will be 1000. Wow! That’s a really bad bug. In ES6, we use `let` to restrict the scope to the blocks. Vars are function scoped.

```javascript
function calculateTotalAmount (vip) {
  var amount = 0 // probably should also be let, but you can mix var and let
  if (vip) {
    let amount = 1 // first amount is still 0
  } 
  { // more crazy blocks!
    let amount = 100 // first amount is still 0
    {
      let amount = 1000 // first amount is still 0
      }
  }  
  return amount
}

console.log(calculateTotalAmount(true))
```

The value is 0, because the `if` block also has `let`. If it had nothing (amount=1), then the expression would have been 1.

When it comes to `const`, things are easier; it’s just an immutable, and it’s also block-scoped like `let`. Just to demonstrate, here are a bunch of constants and they all are okay because they belong to different blocks:

```javascript
function calculateTotalAmount (vip) {
  const amount = 0  
  if (vip) {
    const amount = 1 
  } 
  { // more crazy blocks!
    const amount = 100 
    {
      const amount = 1000
      }
  }  
  return amount
}

console.log(calculateTotalAmount(true))
```

In my humble opinion, `let` and `const` overcomplicate the language. Without them we had only one behavior, now there are multiple scenarios to consider. ;-(

## 9. Classes in ES6

If you love object-oriented programming (OOP), then you’ll love this feature. It makes writing classes and inheriting from them as easy as liking a comment on Facebook.

Classes creation and usage in ES5 was a pain in the rear, because there wasn’t a keyword `class` (it was reserved but did nothing). In addition to that, lots of inheritance patterns like pseudo classical, classical, functional just added to the confusion, pouring gasoline on the fire of religious JavaScript wars.

I won’t show you how to write a class (yes, yes, there are classes, objects inherit from objects) in ES5, because there are many flavors. Let’s take a look at the ES6 example right away. I can tell you that the ES6 class will use prototypes, not the function factory approach. We have a class `baseModel` in which we can define a `constructor` and a `getName()` method:

```javascript
class baseModel {
  constructor(options = {}, data = []) { // class constructor
        this.name = 'Base'
    this.url = 'http://azat.co/api'
        this.data = data
    this.options = options
    }

    getName() { // class method
        console.log(`Class name: ${this.name}`)
    }
}
```

Notice that I’m using default parameter values for options and data. Also, method names don’t need to have the word `function` or the colon (:) anymore. The other big difference is that you can’t assign properties `this.NAME` the same way as methods, i.e., you can’t say `name` at the same indentation level as a method. To set the value of a property, simply assign a value in the constructor.

The `AccountModel` inherits from `baseModel` with `class NAME extends PARENT_NAME`:

```javascript
class AccountModel extends baseModel {
    constructor(options, data) {
```

To call the parent constructor, effortlessly invoke `super()` with params:

```javascript
    super({private: true}, ['32113123123', '524214691']) //call the parent method with super
        this.name = 'Account Model'
    this.url +='/accounts/'
    }
```

If you want to be really fancy, you can set up a getter like this and `accountsData` will be a property:

```javascript
    get accountsData() { //calculated attribute getter
    // ... make XHR
        return this.data
    }
}
```

So how do you actually use this abracadabra? It’s as easy as tricking a three-year old into thinking Santa Claus is real:

```javascript
let accounts = new AccountModel(5)
accounts.getName()
console.log('Data is %s', accounts.accountsData)
```

In case you’re wondering, the output is:

```javascript
Class name: Account Model
Data is %s 32113123123,524214691
```

## 10. Modules in ES6

As you might now, there were no native modules support in JavaScript before ES6. People came up with AMD, RequireJS, CommonJS and other workarounds. Now there are modules with `import` and `export` operands.

In ES5 you would use `<script>` tags with IIFE, or some library like AMD, while in ES6 you can expose your class with export. I am a Node.js guy, so I’ll use CommonJS which is also a Node.js syntax. It’s straightforward to use CommonJS on the browser with the Browserify bunder. Let’s say we have `port` variable and `getAccounts` method in ES5 `module.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  port: 3000,
  getAccounts: function() {
    ...
  }
}
```

In ES5 `main.js`, we would `require('module')` that dependency:

```javascript
var service = require('module.js')
console.log(service.port) // 3000
```

In ES6, we would use `export` and `import`. For example, this is our library in the ES6 `module.js` file:

```javascript
export var port = 3000
export function getAccounts(url) {
  ...
}
```

In the importer ES6 file `main.js`, we use `import {name} from 'my-module'` syntax. For example,

```javascript
import {port, getAccounts} from 'module'
console.log(port) // 3000
```

Or we can import everything as a variable `service` in `main.js`:

```javascript
import * as service from 'module'
console.log(service.port) // 3000
```

Personally, I find the ES6 modules confusing. Yes, they are more eloquent, but Node.js modules won’t change anytime soon. It’s better to have only one style for browser and server JavaScript, so I’ll stick with CommonJS/Node.js style for now.

The support for ES6 modules in the browsers are not coming anytime soon (as of this writing), so you’ll need something like jspm to use ES6 modules.
